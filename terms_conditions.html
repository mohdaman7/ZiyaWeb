        </b>
      </p>

      <p>
        • To confirm participation in the internship program, students are
        requested to make a one-time enrollment contribution of Rs. 5000/-.<br />
        *Kindly note that this amount is non-refundable.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Interns will be eligible for a monthly stipend ranging from Rs. 3000/-
        to Rs. 6000/-, based on performance and consistency.<br />
        Please note that the stipend may be adjusted or withheld if the intern
        is found to be inactive or if project tasks remain incomplete without
        valid reasons.
      </p>

      <p>• The standard internship hours are from 9:30 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>

      <p>
        • Internship assignments may be conducted either remotely or on-site,
        depending on the project requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        • All assigned tasks and projects must be completed on time and
        submitted before the stated deadlines.
      </p>

      <p>
        • We request interns to maintain regular attendance. Any leave must be
        formally requested and approved in advance. Uninformed or frequent leave
        may affect the continuity and assessment of the internship.
      </p>

      <p>• Interns should maintain a professional and presentable appearance</p>

      <p>
        • All communications—written or verbal—should be respectful, clear, and
        appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Interns are expected to maintain strict confidentiality of all data,
        documents, and information shared during the program. Use of such
        materials for external, personal, or commercial purposes is strictly
        prohibited. Sharing company data with external parties is not permitted.
      </p>

      <p><b>We encourage all interns to:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Maintain professionalism and respect in all interactions</li>
        <li>Adhere to ethical practices</li>
        <li>Be accountable for their roles and responsibilities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any violation of these norms may be addressed with appropriate
        corrective actions
      </p>

      <p>
        • Internship certificates will be issued only upon successful completion
        of the internship and submission of final project reports.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The company reserves the right to cancel the internship at any stage
        due to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          lack of compliance with internship guidelines, poor performance, or
          failure to meet minimum participation requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuous lack of response to repeated requests or instructions from
          the company — such as reminders to mark attendance, maintain project
          timelines, or follow communication protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the intern fails to act upon such requests despite multiple
          reminders, it will be treated as negligence, and the internship may be
          cancelled without any refund or certification.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any part of the assigned work or project is found to be generated
          using ChatGPT or any other AI tools without prior permission or proper
          acknowledgment, it will be considered a violation of the internship
          ethics and will result in immediate cancellation of the internship.
        </li>
      </ul>
